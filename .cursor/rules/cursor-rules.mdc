# Always Create MDC Rules in the .cursor/rules Folder

When I ask you to create a new MDC rule, please always create it as a separate file in the `.cursor/rules` directory.

## Guidelines

1. Each rule should be in its own file with a descriptive name ending in `.mdc`
2. Use kebab-case for the filename (e.g., `rule-name-here.mdc`)
3. Include a YAML frontmatter section with at least a description
4. Structure the rule with clear headings and examples when appropriate

## Example Structure

```md
---
description: Brief description of what the rule does
---

# Rule Title

Explanation of the rule...

## Guidelines

1. Guideline one
2. Guideline two
3. Etc.

## Examples

Example usage if applicable...
```

This helps keep the MDC rules organized and makes them easier to manage.
