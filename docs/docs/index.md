# Introduction

The Relay API is an easy-to-use, open-source API to access [Helium oracle data](https://docs.helium.com/oracles/). It enables you to fetch data from Helium Oracles within seconds, eliminating the complexity of extracting the data from AWS S3 buckets.

:::caution The Relay API is currently in beta!
During this phase, you may encounter some issues, bugs, or imperfections. We’re actively working on improving the API and adding more features. [Follow Relay on X](https://twitter.com/relaywireless) for the latest updates on our progress.”

## Use Cases

:::info
The Relay team is actively expanding the API's capabilities. For more information about our development roadmap, [visit our website](https://relaywireless.com).
:::

During the beta phase, the Relay API primarily provides access to Helium Network hotspot data`. With the Relay API, you can:

- Sync hotspot rewards including HNT, IOT, MOBILE.
- Retrieve IoT and Mobile reward shares.
- Query historical Helium earnings data.

## Open Source

:::info
The Relay API was built in partnership with the Helium Foundation. The Foundation awarded Relay a grant to make the Helium oracle data more accessible to the community, removing the need for users to extract data from S3.

For more information, read the [official announcement](https://www.relaywireless.com/blog/introducing-relay-api).
:::

The Relay API is open-source. The backend code will be published under the [Relay GitHub organization](https://github.com/relaywireless) and made publicly accessible for review, feedback, contributions, and independent development. The API will be open-sourced after the beta phase, at the time of its public launch.
