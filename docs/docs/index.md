# Introduction

Welcome to the Helium API documentation! This guide will help you understand our API, its capabilities, and how to integrate it into your applications.

## Overview

The Helium API provides access to IoT, Mobile, and HNT data from the Helium Network. Through our GraphQL API, you can:

- Sync hotspot rewards including HNT, IOT, MOBILE
- Access IoT beacon and witness ingest reports
- Retrieve IoT and Mobile reward shares
- Monitor hotspot network status
- Query Helium historical data
- And get any data provided by Helium Oracles

## Open Source

Relay API is open-source. The backend code will be published under the Relay GitHub organization and made publicly accessible for review, feedback, contributions, and independent development. The API will be open-sourced after the Beta phase, at the time of the public launch.

### Sponsored by Helium Foundation

Relay API was built in partnership with the Helium Foundation. The Foundation awarded a grant to Relay to make Helium Oracle data more accessible to the communityâ€”removing the need to interact directly with AWS S3 and its complexities.

## Why GraphQL?

We chose GraphQL for our API for several key reasons:

1. **Flexibility**: GraphQL allows you to request exactly the data you need, nothing more and nothing less.
2. **Strong Typing**: The schema provides clear contracts about available data and operations.
3. **Efficient Data Loading**: Reduce over-fetching and under-fetching of data common in REST APIs.
4. **Developer Experience**: Better tooling, introspection, and documentation capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. **API Endpoint**: The API is accessible at `https://api.relaywireless.com/graphql`
2. **Authentication**: All requests require an API key, passed via the `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` header
